# HomeWork_Module_E4

Task № 1:
Write a function that takes an object as an argument and outputs to the console all keys and values of its own properties only. This function should not return a value.

Task № 2:
Write a function that takes a string and an object as arguments and then checks if the passed object has a property with the given name. The function must return true or false.

Task № 3:
Write a function that creates an empty object, but without a prototype.

Task № 4:
Implement the following console application similar to the example that was parsed in the video. Implement it on prototypes.
Define a hierarchy of electrical appliances. Plug some into an outlet. Calculate the power consumption. 
There should be at least two such appliances (for example, a desk lamp and a computer). Once you choose an appliance, think about what features it has.

Plan:
1. define a parent function with methods that enable/disable the appliance from an outlet.
2. Create a delegating [[Prototype]] relationship for two specific appliances.
3. Each of the devices should have its own properties and, preferably, methods different from the parent methods.
4. Create instances of each instrument.
5. Output to the console and see the results, be proud of yourself. :)

Task № 5:
Rewrite the console application from the previous unit to classes.
